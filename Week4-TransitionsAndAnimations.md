# Week4 — Transitions and Animation
**Transitions**
* Allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration

**Animations**
* Allows animation of HTML elements without using JavaScript or Flash!

## 1) Transitions
> Process or change over a span of time.

### Syntax — Examples
```
transition: property duration timing-function delay;

transition-property: property:
transition-duration: duration;
transition-timing-function: timing-function;
transition-delay: delay;
```
* Property can be the width
* Duration = how long
* Timing-function = how should it change? should it accelerate?
* Delay = how long until transition starts?
